Title
Purpose: To examine chemical reactions and to determine the relevant chemical equations.

I.
	1. Methane gas and oxygen combust forming water vapor and carbon dioxide gas.
II.
	1. Magnesium strips and oxygen are heated up and synthisize into magnesium oxide.
III.
	1. A copper tube is put into a test tube filled with aqueous silver nitrate and after a single replacement forms aqueous copper (II) nitrate and a silver percipitate.
IV.
	1. Liquid hydrogen peroxide (with solid? manganese dioxide as a catylist) decomposes into liquid water and oxygen gas.
V.
	1. Solid zinc and aqueous hydrochloric acid under go single replacement, forming  hydrogen gas and aquous zinc chloride.
VI.
	1. A copper (II) sulfate solution and with a sodium hydroxide solution undergo double replacement, forming solid copper (II) hydroxide and aqueous sodium sulfate.
VII.
	1. A lead (II) nitrate solution and a postassium iodide solution under go double replacement, forming lead(II) iodide and postassium nitrate.

Conclusion:
	Summerizes the different types of reactions, and provides real life examples of each. Write the examples out and explain where you could see it.
