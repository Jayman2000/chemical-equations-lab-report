Conclusion:
	Summerizes the different types of reactions, and provides real life examples of each. Write the examples out and explain where you could see it.

	A synthesis reaction is a reaction in which multiple less complex compounds react to form fewer, more complex compounds. A real life example of
	this is photosynthesis, when a plant takes in water and carbon dioxide to create food (glucose). The formula is 6CO2 + 6H20 --> C6H12O + 6O2.
	A decomposition reaction is the opposite of a synthesis. It is when more complex compounds break down to form many less complex compounds. An example
	of this is cellular respiration, which is how our bodies use glucose for energy. The formula is C6H12O6 + 6O2 --> 6CO2 + 6H2O. 
	A single replacement reaction is when an ion that is alone switches with an ion that is in a compound. A real life example of this is the rusting of steel.
	The formula is Fe2 + 2H2O --> Fe(OH)2 + H2. A double replacement reaction is when ions in 2 compounds switch places to form 2 different compounds.
	A real life example of this is antacids neutralizing stomach acids. The formula is Ca(OH) 2 + 2HCl --> CaCl2 + 2H2O. A combustion reaction is when a hydrocarbons
	reacts with O2 and forms CO2 and water. A real life example is burning gasoline. The formula is 2C8H18 + 25O2 --> 16CO2 + 18H2O.
