Title
Purpose: To examine chemical reactions and to determine the relevant chemical equations.

I.
	1. Methane gas and oxygen combust forming water vapor and carbon dioxide gas.
	
	2. CH4(g) + 2O2(g) -[sparker]-> 2H2O(g) + CO2(g)
II.
	1. Magnesium strips and oxygen gas are heated up and synthisize into a magnesium oxide powder.
	
	2. 2Mg(s) + O2(g) -[heat]-> 2MgO(g)
III.
	1. A copper tube is put into a test tube filled with aqueous silver nitrate and after a single replacement forms aqueous copper (II) nitrate and a silver percipitate.
	
	2. Cu(s) + 2AgNO3(aq) --> Cu(NO3)2(aq) + 2Ag(s)
IV.
	1. Liquid hydrogen peroxide (with solid? manganese dioxide as a catylist) decomposes into liquid water and oxygen gas.
	
	2. 2H2O2(l) + -[manganese dioxide]-> 2H2O(l) + O2(g)
V.
	1. Solid zinc and aqueous hydrochloric acid under go single replacement, forming aquous zinc chloride and hydrogen gas.
	
	2. 2Zn(s) + 2HCl(aq) --> 2ZnCl(aq) + H2(g)
VI.
	1. A copper (II) sulfate solution and a sodium hydroxide solution undergo double replacement, forming solid copper (II) hydroxide and aqueous sodium sulfate.
	
	2. CuSO4(l) + 2NaOH(l) --> Cu(OH)2(s) + Na2SO4(aq)
VII.
	1. A lead (II) nitrate solution and a postassium iodide solution under go double replacement, forming lead(II) iodide and postassium nitrate.
	
	2. Pb(NO3)2(l) + KI(l) --> PbI2(?) 2KNO3(?)

Conclusion:
	Summerizes the different types of reactions, and provides real life examples of each. Write the examples out and explain where you could see it.
